title: Welcome to inTake
description:
  inTake is a self-hosted deployment and infrastructure platform built for
  developers and teams who want the flexibility of managing their own servers —
  without the complexity of traditional DevOps tools or container orchestration.
---

Think of it as a simpler alternative to tools like Vercel, Railway, or Heroku —
but designed for **self-hosting**, **server control**, and **real production
use-cases**.

## What Makes inTake Different

- 🚀 **Multi-server orchestration over SSH** — scale across any number of
  servers without containers or Kubernetes.
- ⚙️ **Production-ready workflows** — deploy apps, run cron jobs, manage
  databases, and monitor everything from a single UI.
- 🧩 **Bring your own stack** — supports Node.js, PHP, Python, Go, Ruby, and
  databases like MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis, and more.
- 🔐 **No vendor lock-in** — use your own infrastructure, your own cloud
  provider, and extend the platform freely.
- 💻 **Built for developers** — designed with a dev-first mindset for speed,
  clarity, and control.
