inTake lets you connect your AWS account and manage your cloud infrastructure
directly from the inTake interface. You can create, update, and delete
resources, as well as monitor their status and logsâ€”all in one place.

## Connect your AWS account

To connect your AWS account, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [**Integrations**](https://demo.gointake.ca/integrations) section
   in inTake.
2. Click on the **Settings** button on the AWS card.
3. Click on the **Connect Account** button.
4. Enter a name for your AWS account.
5. Provide your **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**.  
   You can generate these in the AWS IAM console. If you donâ€™t have them yet,
   see the [Create IAM Role](#create-iam-role) section below.

  Your AWS credentials are encrypted before being stored. Even in the unlikely
  event of a data breach, your credentials remain secure.

6. Click on the **Save** button.

Your AWS account is now connected to inTake ðŸŽ‰.

### Create IAM Role

inTake requires an IAM(Identity and Access Management) role to access your AWS
account. This role must have permissions to create and manage resources in your
account. You can create a new IAM role or use an existing one. If you choose to
create a new role or use the existing one, make sure to attach the necessary
policies to it. The following policies are required:

<Callout type='info'>
  <strong>Required Policy:</strong> <code>AmazonEC2FullAccess</code> â€” Grants
  inTake permission to create and manage EC2 instances.
</Callout>

Follow these steps to create an IAM role with the necessary permissions:

1. Log in to your AWS account & navigate to dashboard.
2. Search for IAM in the search bar and click on it.
3. Select **Users**.
4. Click **Create user** button.
5. Enter username and click **next**.
6. In the permissions tab, select **Attach policies directly**.

10. Click on **Create access key**.
11. Select **Other** and click **next**.
12. (Optional) Add a description, then click **Create access key**.
13. Copy the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**â€”you'll need these to
    connect your account to inTake.

<Callout type='warn'>
  Currently, inTake supports creating new EC2 instances only. Support for
  managing existing instances is coming soon.

### Create EC2 instance

Once your AWS account is connected, you can launch EC2 instances. To create an
EC2 instance, follow these steps:
