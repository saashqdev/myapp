Skip months of design and development work. HextaUI provides a complete set of base components that you can copy, adapt, and personalize for your projects. These components are designed to be flexible, customizable, and easy to integrate into your applications.

## What Are Base Components?

Base components are the fundamental building blocks of your user interface. They include essential elements like buttons, inputs, modals, and more. HextaUI's base components are designed to be:

- **Modular**: Each component is self-contained, allowing you to use only what you need.
- **Customizable**: Easily change styles, colors, and behaviors to fit your design requirements.
- **Responsive**: Built with modern design principles, ensuring they look great on all devices.
- **Accessible**: Designed with accessibility in mind, following best practices to ensure all users can interact with your application.

## Ready to Use

Each component in HextaUI comes with a live example and code snippet that you can copy directly into your project. This means you can get started quickly without having to build everything from scratch.
