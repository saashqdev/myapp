### Create a Next.js project

To create a new Next.js project, you can use the following command:

```package-install
npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app
```

Make sure to enable `Typescript` and `Tailwind CSS` during the setup process. You can do this by selecting the appropriate options when prompted.

Replace `my-nextjs-app` with your desired project name.

### Install HextaUI

To install HextaUI in your Next.js project, navigate to your project directory and run:

```package-install
npm install hextaui@latest
```

### Initialize HextaUI

Run the `init` command to initialize HextaUI in your project:

```package-install
npx hextaui@latest init
```

### Add components

You can now start using HextaUI components in your Next.js project.

```package-install
npx hextaui@latest add button
```

This command will add `Button` component to your project. You can simply import the button component from `components/ui` in your project.

```ts title="app/page.tsx"
import { Button } from "components/ui/button"; // [!code highlight]

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to HextaUI with Next.js!</h1>
      <Button>Click Me!</Button> // [!code highlight]
    </main>
  );
}
```
