## How is inTake built

When inTake is installed, it will setup the following:

- Built using **Next.js** for the frontend and backend API.
- Uses **Postgres** as the primary database to store user, server, and service
  details. **PayloadCMS**
- **Redis** is used for caching and fast data retrieval.
- **BullMQ** (built on Redis) is used for queueing and managing long-running
  tasks like server provisioning and service deployments.

## Server connection & Setup

- inTake uses **node-ssh** (a library for SSH connections in Node.js) to connect
  to the userâ€™s server.
- Once connected, inTake executes automated scripts to:
  - Install **Dokku** (a self-hosted PaaS like Heroku).
  - Install **Netdata** (for real-time monitoring of the server).
  - Install **Railpack** (a tool that simplifies server management).
