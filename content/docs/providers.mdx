  Providers are the building blocks of your infrastructure. They allow you to
  manage and provision resources across various cloud platforms and services.

In this section, we will explore the different providers available in our
system, how to configure them, and best practices for using them effectively.

### Connect to Providers

To connect to a provider, Go to the **Servers** page and click on the **Add
Server** button. You will be prompted to select a provider from the list of
available providers. Once you select a provider, you will need to provide the
necessary credentials and configuration details to establish a connection.
